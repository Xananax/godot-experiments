# Godot experiments

Things I do when idly doodling code between things.

None of the projects listed here will be actively worked on. Contributions are welcome if anyone is interested.

They're released under [NPLv7+](https://thufie.lain.haus/NPL.html)

In short: you can do whatever you want with with the work, including using it commercially, provided that you release the work under the same terms.

Exception:

- you cannot use the work for patents.
- you cannot use the work for harm, surveillance, discrimination, law enforcement, pollution.
- in a corporation, you cannot use the work commercially, unless in a worker-owned cooperative, or otherwise a company that redistributes surplus equally amongst workers.

Please read the [full terms](./LICENSE) for proper wording.
